Week 1 — Foundations: Data, Math, and First Models

1.1 — Working With Core Python Data Tools

We explored how modern data workflows actually come together in practice. Using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, we cleaned datasets, transformed arrays, and visualized patterns. This built intuition for how raw data becomes structured insight — the backbone for every future model.

1.2 — Linear Regression From Scratch

We moved beyond libraries and engineered a full linear regression pipeline manually. Features were normalized, a cost function was derived, gradients were implemented, and weights were optimized iteratively. The model predicted student marks — proving that understanding the mechanics beats blindly calling .fit().

1.3 — Logistic Regression for Decision Making

We simulated a scientist testing rocket propellants and built a logistics model to classify whether the propellant performed efficiently. This meant converting probabilities into binary decisions and understanding why classification needs different math than regression. The exercise strengthened feature preparation, interpretation, and evaluation thinking.

Week 2 — Deep Learning and Modern Vision Systems

2.1 — Image Classification Neural Network

We constructed an end-to-end CNN pipeline that learned to differentiate cartoon characters from images. Data was augmented, normalized, split into training/validation sets, and passed through convolutional layers with pooling and dense heads. The model evolved from guesses to pattern recognition — showing how machines “learn” visual structure.

2.2 — Object Detection With YOLOv8

We escalated from recognizing what is in an image to detecting where. Using YOLOv8, custom datasets were prepared, trained, and validated. We tuned epochs, batch sizes, and image resolutions, then generated bounding-box predictions. This marked the transition from academic modeling to real applied AI systems capable of deployment.
